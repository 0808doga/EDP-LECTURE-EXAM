## What is EDP?

Event-Driven Programming (EDP) is a way to make programs react to events like user actions or data changes. It's often used in apps that need to be flexible and responsive.

## About This Project

This project is a simple Python example of EDP. It has four parts:

1. **Sensor**: Detects something and sends an event.
2. **Processor**: Takes the Sensor's data and processes it.
3. **Logger**: Saves the processed data.
4. **UI**: Shows the final result.

## How It Works

- The Sensor detects something (like "Temperature: 25Â°C") and sends a `data_detected` event.
- The Processor listens for that event, processes the data, and sends a `data_processed` event.
- The Logger listens for processed data and logs it.
- The UI listens for logged data and shows it to the user.


## Why Use EDP?

This project shows how EDP makes programs modular, flexible, and easy to extend. Feel free to explore and build on it!
